And if you want to get pregnant, you can have the IUD removed at any time. There aretwo types: Hormonal and non-hormonal.

It's so small, in fact, most people can't see it once it's inserted—which means it can be your little secret, if you're so inclined. The implant releases progestin, a hormone that keeps your ovaries from releasing eggs and thickens your cervical mucus—which helps block sperm from getting to the egg in the first place.

Once you get it, your birth control is covered for three full months—there’s nothing else you have to do. Some people call the shot “Depo,” short for Depo-Provera. (Pronounced like Johnny Depp-oh.) The shot contains progestin, a hormone that prevents your ovaries from releasing eggs. It also thickens your cervical mucus, which helps block sperm from getting to the egg in the first place. Worth considering even if you're afraid of needles... Because what's a little prick compared to a pregnancy?\" />\n          <List  title=\"The Patch\" link=\"css/img/patch.jpg\"description=\"The patch is a thin, beige piece of plastic that looks like a square Band-Aid.

The hormones also thicken your cervical mucus, which helps to block sperm from getting to the egg in the first place.

It's not the prettiest thing in the world (it looks a bit like a floppy, clear elephant trunk) but it is a method that gives you lots of control. Internal condoms work the same way that condoms do, except that you wear one on the inside instead of sticking it on a penis.

It's pretty small—just two inches across—and you insert it way up in your vagina before you have sex. The sponge works in two ways: It blocks your cervix to keep sperm from getting into your uterus, and it continuously releases spermicide.

Then it covers your cervix and keeps sperm out of your uterus.

There's only one brand of cervical cap available in the U.S. today, and it's jauntily named the FemCap.
