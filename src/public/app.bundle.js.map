It's not the prettiest thing in the world (it looks a bit like a floppy, clear elephant trunk) but it is a method that gives you lots of control. Internal condoms work the same way that condoms do, except that you wear one on the inside instead of sticking it on a penis. They keep the guy's sperm inside the condom and out of your vagina.\"/>\n          <List  title=\"Sponge\" link=\"css/img/sponge.png\"description=\"The sponge is a round piece of white plastic foam with a little dimple on one side and a nylon loop across the top that looks like shoelace material. It's pretty small—just two inches across—and you insert it way up in your vagina before you have sex. The sponge works in two ways: It blocks your cervix to keep sperm from getting into your uterus, and it continuously releases spermicide. Think of it like a bouncer at the nightclub door to your uterus.\"/>\n          <List  title=\"Diaphragm\" link=\"css/img/diaphragm.jpg\"description=\"A diaphragm is a shallow, dome-shaped cup made of silicone. (Honestly, it looks like Meg Griffin's hat on The Family Guy. Except it's only a few inches in diameter.) You insert the diaphragm into your vagina. Then it covers your cervix and keeps sperm out of your uterus. One super important thing to remember: For a diaphragm to work effectively, you need to use it with spermicide.\"/>\n          </ul>\n          <ul className=\"row\">\n          <List  title=\"The Ring\" link=\"css/img/ring.jpg\"description=\"The ring (brand name: NuvaRing) is a small, bendable ring that you insert into your vagina. (It kind of looks like one of those jelly bracelets from the 80s, but it feels a tiny bit stiffer.) You leave it in place for three weeks at a time, then take it out for the fourth week. The ring works by giving off hormones that prevent your ovaries from releasing eggs. The hormones also thicken your cervical mucus, which helps to block sperm from getting to the egg in the first place.\"/>\n          <List  title=\"Condom\" link=\"css/img/condoms.jpg\"description=\"Condoms are one of the most popular forms of birth control out there. They slip over the penis to prevent pregnancy and lower the risk of STIs by keeping sperm inside the condom and out of the vagina. (There are also internal condoms that go inside the vagina.) Condoms come in hundreds of shapes and sizes, with lube and without.\"/>\n          <List  title=\"'Not Right Now'\" link=\"css/img/no.png\" description=\"'Not right now' is our way of saying 'no vaginal sex.' It’s a great method as far as effectiveness is concerned—if you use it 100% of the time, you’re guaranteed to not get pregnant. And if you’re avoiding sexual activity altogether, you’ll be safe from STIs too. But it does involve a whole lot of self-control.\"/>\n          <List  title=\"Spermicide\" link=\"css/img/spermicide.png\"description=\"Spermicide describes a bunch of different creams, films, foams, gels, and suppositories that contain chemicals that stop sperm from moving. You insert it deep in your vagina, so it also keeps sperm from getting through your cervix and into your uterus.\"/>\n          </ul>\n          <ul className=\"row\">\n          <List title=\"Cervical Cap\" link=\"css/img/cervical_cap.png\"description=\"A cervical cap is a silicone cup you insert in your vagina to cover your cervix and keep sperm out of your uterus. The 'cap' part of the name is pretty dead on—the thing looks like a little rubber sailor's hat, maybe an inch and a half wide and one inch high. There's only one brand of cervical cap available in the U.S. today, and it's jauntily named the FemCap. One super important thing to remember: You need to use a cervical cap with spermicide for it to be most effective.\" />\n          <List title=\"Emergency Contraception\" link=\"css/img/EC.png\"description=\"Emergency Contraception (EC) can stop a pregnancy before it starts. (That means the EC pills are not the same as the abortion pill.) There are four types of EC to choose from and they all work up to 5 days (or 120 hours) after unprotected sex. But use it sooner rather than later to reduce the possibility of getting pregnant.\" />\n          <List title=\"Withdrawal\" link=\"css/img/exit.jpg\"description=\"Withdrawal is the oldest form of birth control on the planet. There's not much to explain, really. The guy pulls out before he ejaculates. End of story. Some people call withdrawal the 'pull out method.' The key thing to remember is this: You've got to do it right—every single time—for withdrawal to be effective.\" />\n          <List title=\"Fertility Awareness\" link=\"css/img/awareness.jpg\"description=\"Fertility awareness-based methods—or natural family planning—are all about tracking your menstrual cycle to determine the days that you can get pregnant.
