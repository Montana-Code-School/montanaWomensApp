It's a little less than two inches across, and comes in one—and only one—color. (Beige.) You stick the patch on your skin and it gives off hormones that prevent your ovaries from releasing eggs. The hormones also thicken your cervical mucus, which helps to block sperm from getting to the egg in the first place.

Some people call it 'oral contraception.' You take it once a day, at the same time every day. There are lots of different kinds of pills on the market, and new ones come out all the time.

It's not the prettiest thing in the world (it looks a bit like a floppy, clear elephant trunk) but it is a method that gives you lots of control. Internal condoms work the same way that condoms do, except that you wear one on the inside instead of sticking it on a penis. They keep the guy's sperm inside the condom and out of your vagina.\"/>\n          <List  title=\"Sponge\" link=\"css/img/sponge.png\"description=\"The sponge is a round piece of white plastic foam with a little dimple on one side and a nylon loop across the top that looks like shoelace material. It's pretty small—just two inches across—and you insert it way up in your vagina before you have sex. The sponge works in two ways: It blocks your cervix to keep sperm from getting into your uterus, and it continuously releases spermicide. Think of it like a bouncer at the nightclub door to your uterus.\"/>\n          <List  title=\"Diaphragm\" link=\"css/img/diaphragm.jpg\"description=\"A diaphragm is a shallow, dome-shaped cup made of silicone. (Honestly, it looks like Meg Griffin's hat on The Family Guy. Except it's only a few inches in diameter.) You insert the diaphragm into your vagina. Then it covers your cervix and keeps sperm out of your uterus. One super important thing to remember: For a diaphragm to work effectively, you need to use it with spermicide.\"/>\n          </ul>\n          <ul className=\"row bc-row\" style={borderBottom}>\n          <List  title=\"The Ring\" link=\"css/img/ring.jpg\"description=\"The ring (brand name: NuvaRing) is a small, bendable ring that you insert into your vagina.

The ring works by giving off hormones that prevent your ovaries from releasing eggs. The hormones also thicken your cervical mucus, which helps to block sperm from getting to the egg in the first place.\"/>\n          <List  title=\"Condom\" link=\"css/img/condoms.jpg\"description=\"Condoms are one of the most popular forms of birth control out there.

There's only one brand of cervical cap available in the U.S. today, and it's jauntily named the FemCap.
