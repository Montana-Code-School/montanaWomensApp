Leanne aims to flexibly structure the course of treatment to accommodate her clients therapeutic needs. She assists people to transform from feeling blocked in some area of their lives to achieving their own definition of success from weekly sessions.The decision to attend therapy is a significant one. People seek therapy to deal with issues, conflicts, and problems associated with a range of topics. What underlies a successful therapeutic relationship is the creation of a safe place for one to explore conflicts, issues, and feelings. From that premise, meaningful and significant growth occurs. The kind of growth one is seeking is best decided upon by careful collaboration between the therapist and the client.
