And if you want to get pregnant, you can have the IUD removed at any time. There aretwo types: Hormonal and non-hormonal.

The shot contains progestin, a hormone that prevents your ovaries from releasing eggs. It also thickens your cervical mucus, which helps block sperm from getting to the egg in the first place.

The hormones also thicken your cervical mucus, which helps to block sperm from getting to the egg in the first place.
